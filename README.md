# GrowattMonitorUi

 UI monitor for GROWATT hibrid solar inverters

Due to insatisfaction ( poor application quality/wrong values/unexpectedly closing ) of the official GROWATT PC application that monitors the inverter thru serial/USB port, I put several hours together to develop my own application.

At this moment the application does not save monitoring data into a database but it is in todo list together with an android monitoring application.

Currently is configured to be built only for Windows, but soon will be available for MacOsX and Linux as well.

The application diaplay more information about the state of the inverter including inverter/DC-DC temperature and current day/total power for all three inputs, Grid/PV/Battery.

Further, I will hack/reprogram the ShineWifi-F module with my own application to be able to connect the PC application or use scripts to retrive data from the module.
